            "Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. <br>
            It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, <br>
            so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… <br>
            He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. <br>
            he dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. <br>
            He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. <br>
            Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. <br>
            Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself." - <a  id="tribute-link" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious" target="_blank">Sheev Palpatine or Darth Sidious.</a>
